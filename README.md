# Introduction

Demo project for learning more advanced programming (C++ for now)

The goal is to create a basic 2D solar system simulation with a simple gui
using a simplified model for gravity/interactions


# Solar system model:
* Position and velocity in 2 dimensions
* Consider the case where there is only 1 star
* The star always has zero velocity (fixed position)
* Planets only interact with the star and no other objects
* Astronomical objects (stars/planets) are considered point-objects and have no radius (though in the code they might, to no effect currently)
