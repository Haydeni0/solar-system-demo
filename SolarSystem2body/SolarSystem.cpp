/* 
* First create a solar system where the star is in a fixed position and the planets onlly interact with the sun not each other
* This will give analytic results for the equations of motion of the planets
* Use astronomical units (AU) for distances, solar masses for the mass of stars
* Use class inheritance for individual stars and planets based off a base star and a base planet class
